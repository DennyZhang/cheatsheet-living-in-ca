#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
In California, vehicles must undergo a biennial smog inspection in order to renew your registration. New residents to California will be required to have an initial inspection to register, even if you have a current certificate from your previous state. Testing can be completed at DMV-approved locations throughout your county. Safety inspections are not generally required for registration or renewal.

In California, most vehicles are required to be smog checked every 2 years. Keep reading below for information about smog inspections in California, including forms and fees you'll need to provide.

Car registration. If you're wondering whether you are required to register your car after moving to a new state, the short answer is YES. Regrettably, you won't be able to complete this task online, so you'll really need to find time in your busy schedule and do it in person at a local DMV office.

It's important to note that different U.S. states have different deadlines for vehicle registration - some will give you one month to do it, while others require you to do it within 10 days (Florida). Contact the nearest DMV office to learn what documents you will need for the registration process - note that a car insurance policy, purchased from the destination state, is a must.

Want to drive in your new state? You'll need a new driver's license from your state's DMV. Be sure to check your state's requirements, as many states require new residents to obtain their driver's license within a specific time window after moving. Keep in mind that while requirements for transferring a driver's license vary from state to state, you'll most likely need a driver's license, proof of residency, proof of your social security number and an additional form of identification.

Health care providers. Moving to another state also means that you're expected to find new health care providers for you and your family members, including your pet. Remember that your health, and the health of the people around you, is a top priority no matter what happens.

Regardless of whether you'll be looking for primary care doctors, specialized doctors or licensed vets, you will need the necessary documentation for the registration process. Usually, the required documents are medical records and vaccination papers which you should have requested from your old physician and veterinarian prior to the actual move.
